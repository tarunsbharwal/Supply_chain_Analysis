# Supply-Chain-Analysis
Supply Chain Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on performing supply chain analysis using a dataset containing various attributes such as product types, SKU, price, availability, sales, revenue, stock levels, lead times, and defect rates. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain.

Dataset
The dataset contains 100 records with the following key features:

Product Types: Cosmetics, Haircare, Skincare
Metrics: Price, Number of Products Sold, Revenue Generated, Stock Levels, Lead Times, Order Quantities, Shipping Times, Shipping Costs, Manufacturing Lead Time, Manufacturing Costs, Defect Rates, Transportation Modes, and more.
Project Steps
1. Price vs. Revenue Analysis
A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between product price and revenue generated.
Key Insight: Higher-priced skincare products tend to generate more revenue, indicating strong customer demand in this segment.
2. Sales by Product Type
A pie chart is used to break down sales by product type.
Key Insight: Skincare products account for 45% of sales, making them the largest revenue driver.
3. Revenue by Shipping Carrier
A bar chart compares total revenue generated by different shipping carriers.
Key Insight: Carrier B generates the most revenue but is also the most costly.
4. Average Lead Time & Manufacturing Costs
Analysis of average lead times and manufacturing costs across product types.
Key Insight: Cosmetics have the lowest lead time and manufacturing costs, while haircare and skincare products have higher costs.
5. SKU Analysis
Line charts visualize revenue and stock levels for each SKU.
Key Insight: Monitoring SKUs with low stock levels and high order quantities can optimize restocking strategies.
6. Shipping Costs & Transportation Modes
Bar charts and pie charts break down shipping costs by carrier and cost distribution by transportation mode.
Key Insight: Road and rail modes of transportation are the most costly, while air transportation results in the lowest defect rates.
7. Defect Rate Analysis
A bar chart shows the defect rates by product type, and a pie chart visualizes defect rates by transportation mode.
Key Insight: Haircare products have higher defect rates, particularly when transported by road.


Key Insights and Recommendations
Skincare Focus: Continue prioritizing skincare products as they are the largest revenue driver. Optimize pricing strategy for this category.

Carrier Evaluation: Explore cost-effective alternatives to Carrier B while maintaining performance.

Defect Reduction: Focus on improving quality control for haircare products and shift more transportation to air to reduce defect rates.

Inventory Optimization: Address SKUs with high demand and low stock levels to prevent stockouts.

Lead Time Optimization: Reducing lead times for haircare and skincare products can improve responsiveness to market demand.

Cost Efficiency in Transportation: Optimizing transportation modes may reduce overall supply chain costs.


Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into the supply chain's performance and areas for improvement. By analyzing key metrics such as sales performance, defect rates, transportation costs, and SKU-level data, the company can optimize its supply chain, reduce costs, and enhance product quality. Further analysis and continuous monitoring are recommended to support strategic decision-making.
